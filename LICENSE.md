Hey! You’ve stumbled across an app I’ve written in Swift. Since this is a public repository, I cannot stop you from looking at the code, nor do I want to. Feel free to learn from it and even include bits of it in your own apps. All I ask is that you do not distribute copies of this project yourself, for free or for profit. Thanks!
